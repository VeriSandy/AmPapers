1. Given an array and an operation -> foo(index, value), the value can be either 1 or -1, 
if foo(index, value) is called, it will add ‘value’ to all elements from index till end of the array, 
find minimum number of operation to make all array elements 0.

Idea -- An idea can be here 
If numbers are >0 
Sort number in increasing order, so keep decreasing eqaul to element' value at any index from start to end

1, 5, 7, 9 
0, 4, 6, 8  ==> dec 1(as at index 0) from all ele and move to next 
0, 0, 2, 4  ==> dec 4(as at index 1) from all elm and move to next
0, 0, 0, 2  ==> dec 2(as at index 2) from all elm and move to next
0, 0, 0, 0  ==> dec 2(as at index 3) from all elm and move to next
min operations == max value in array

if number are <0 
then put them in dec order and keep increasing 
-1 -7 -9 ==> min operation 9

if mixture of negative and positive 

put them in inc order and then count
