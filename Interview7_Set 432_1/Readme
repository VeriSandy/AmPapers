6. Given two arrays. One is for tasks (Processes) and each element depicts the amount of cores required to run the task. 
   2nd array is an array of CPU where each element depicts the no of cores in it.
   We have to tell how many maximum number of tasks can be allocated.  
   Example: Task:  [3, 5, 7], Cores: [1, 3, 5] . Here only task 0 and 1 can be allocated to CPU 1 and 2 . So, answer=2.
